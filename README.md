Repo for the Bricktip Browser extension 

Lego Sets Extension created by M.Nijdam. Displays a tooltip with set information on every number on a page. Found numbers are listed on the popup for easy reference.

Don't have time to update to V3 of the brickset api. That's also the reason it's no longer available in de Chrome Webstore for extensions.
